Q.) Elaborate what your internship or academic projects were?

	In my college, I worked on a Hotel Management System project. It helped manage hotel operations like room booking, customer check-ins/outs, staff details, and billing. It was built using Java, JSP/Servlets, and MySQL.
	

a) What did the system do?

The system allowed:

	1)Room Booking: Check room availability and book rooms.			
	2)Customer Management: Store and manage customer details like check-in/check-out.	
	3)Billing: Automated bill generation with taxes and additional charges.	
	4)Staff Management: Track staff details and schedules.



b) What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?

	Local Hotel Software: Many small hotels use desktop-based software for room and customer management.


c) How do you approach the development problem?

	1) Understand Requirements: Listed features needed, like booking, billing, and customer data.
	2) Design: Made diagrams to understand the flow of the system.
	3) Development: Built features one by one (like booking first, then billing).
	4) Testing: Tested every module to avoid errors.



d) What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?

	1)Email Validation: Used a regex code to validate email input.
	2)Database Connection: Learned how to handle database connections efficiently.


e) What did you learn from some very specific copy-paste?

	1)Exception Handling: Learned how to handle errors while connecting to the database properly.	
	2)SQL Pagination: Learned how to show large data in smaller parts using LIMIT and OFFSET.
